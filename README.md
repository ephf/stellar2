# Stellar2 (demo)

I feel like I messed up on the first one so I made another

```bash
$ npm i
```

(have `nodemon` installed)

```bash
$ npm t
```

Stellar can render server-side or client-side and preloads all content found in anchors (unless they are external links). Static html is found in `index.html` and dynamic pages are in the `/pages` directory. There is alot more but this is just a test.
